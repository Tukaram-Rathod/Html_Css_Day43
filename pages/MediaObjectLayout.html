        Australia's Ian Chappell praised the skilled reserve bowlers in the Indian squad for digging out
        impressive performances in their successful tour down under despite the team being hampered by 
        constant injuries.
        
        The former Australia skipper also wondered whether retired players would want to earn same rewards 
        as the current crop of cricketers does or whether it is now the current players missing being part 
        of a different era.

        It would be interesting to discover if retired cricketers envied the rewards paid their modern 
        counterparts or whether current players would swap today's whirling merry-go-round for the casual 
        approach of the past. I suspect most international cricketers are just happy to have played," said Chappell.
